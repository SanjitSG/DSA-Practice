// TODO - Time and Space complexity

/* What is time complexity?
 -> The rate at which the time, required to run the code, changes w.r.t the input size, is considered as time complexity.

 3 Rules -
 1. Calculate the time complexity for the worst-case scenario.
 2. Avoid including the constant terms.
 3.Avoid the lower values.

Big-O notation

What is space complexity?
-> Auxiliary space + input space.
